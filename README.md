## ❓How does it work?

i'm 69% sure it's powered by:

- Random magical npm packages
- A suspicious amount of glitter
- Possibly cursed and or blessed JavaScript

If it stops working, try blowing on your keyboard and whispering "girlmode" three times

## 🧪 Examples

```js
if (user.confused) {
  press();
  console.log("Wait why do I feel like a girl");
}
```
